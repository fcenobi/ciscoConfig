Reserved range
 - All packets out the tunnel use quartets 2 and 3 of the source packet to find the destination ipv4 address
 - Means quartets 2 and 3 have to be the subnet for all end traffic

ipv6 general-prefix JAMES 6to4 f0/0
int tunnel 0
	ipv6 address 2002:A00:1::1/64		(A00:1 = ipv4 address of source int)
	tunnel source f0/0
	tunnel mode ipv6ip 6to4

ipv6 route 2002::/16



Global Unicast Range
 - All packets need an extra route on the sending router
 - Quartets 2 and 3 can no longer be used for storing the destination ipv4 address

ip route 2002:100::1/64 2002:A00:2::2		(A00:2 = ipv4 destination address int)
ip route 2002::/16
